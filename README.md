Just my attempts at learning Rust...

Directories:
* **hello:** Hello, World!
* **guessing_game**: Simple intro project from [https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/guessing-game.html](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/guessing-game.html).
* **list:** two different attempts at creating a linked list based on [http://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/too-many-lists/book/second-final.html](http://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/too-many-lists/book/second-final.html) and also an ordered implementation in ``lucas.rs``.

For each directory listed above, just go in to the directory and run either ``cargo test`` or ``cargo run``.
