Just my attempts at learning Rust...

Directories:
* **hello:** Hello, World!
* **list:** two different attempts at creating a linked list based on [http://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/too-many-lists/book/second-final.html](http://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/too-many-lists/book/second-final.html).

For each directory listed above, just go in to the directory and run either ``cargo test`` or ``cargo run``.
